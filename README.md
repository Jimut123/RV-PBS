# The RV-PBS dataset

This repository hosts the dataset created for the paper titled ***“Instance Segmentation of Peripheral Blood Smear and Refining Classification via Domain Adaptation“.***

The dataset is annotated using [CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat). We are planning to release an extended version of this dataset soon. If you are a haematologist, then you could help us by annotating and adding more data. **Please make sure that the data is ethically cleared before uploading in public servers, such as Github.**
