# The RV-PBS (Ramakrishna Vivekananda Peripheral Blood Smear) dataset

## This repository hosts the dataset created for the paper titled ***[Advancing instance segmentation and WBC classification in peripheral blood smear through domain adaptation: A study on PBC and the novel RV-PBS datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424005268?via%3Dihub#d1e3975).***

***

The dataset is annotated using [CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat). We are planning to release an extended version of this dataset soon. If you are a haematologist, then you could help us by annotating and adding more data. **Please make sure that the data is ethically cleared before uploading new data in public servers, such as Github.**

### Data creation process

For this study, we have created a novel WBC dataset comprising 10 classes known as the ramakirshna vivekananda peripheral blood smear (RV-PBS) dataset. Air dried peripheral blood smears are stained by Leishman stain following standard protocol and examined under an oil immersion lens using 10X eyepiece magnification (final magnificationâ€“1000X). Photographs taken by iPhone XR 12-megapixel camera with f/1.8 aperture. The dataset comprises high resolution (4032 x 3024) images of blood smear slides.
